Facial Emotion Recognition 

Facial Emotion Detection (FED) is a computer vision and artificial intelligence task that aims to automatically recognize human emotions from facial expressions using images or videos.
It is the process of identifying the emotional state of a person based on the analysis of their facial features such as the eyes, eyebrows, mouth, etc.

Typical emotions detected:

😠 Angry

😢 Sad

😀 Happy

😮 Surprise

😐 Neutral

😨 Fear

😖 Disgust

The general pipeline for facial emotion detection includes:

1. Face Detection
Locate and extract the face region from the image.

Tools: OpenCV, or pre-trained CNN face detectors.

2. Preprocessing
Resize, normalize, and convert images to a standard format.

Enhance features if needed (e.g., histogram equalization).

3. Feature Extraction
Deep learning models automatically extract features from the image.

Common models: CNNs like EfficientNet

4. Emotion Classification
The model predicts one of the predefined emotion classes.

Usually uses a softmax layer to output class probabilities.
